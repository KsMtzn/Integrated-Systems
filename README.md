# Integrated-Systems
Image filtering procedure, with Laplacian filter for sharpening the edges of an image, using a variety of different techniques of memory hierarchy and data reusing by cache memory, to achieve the most efficient operation of the CPU. 

**Project1-Loop Optimization** : The goal of the first project was the observation and comparison of the various loop transforms with which the image was filtered. 
Loop Transforms :
1)Loop unrolling
2)Loop Fusion - Loop Fision
3)Loop Interchange
4)Loop Tilling
5)Loop Collapsing
6)Loop Inversion

**Project2-Memory Mapping** : During the second project different memory hierarchies were applied and compared based on the CPU cycles each one produced.

**Project3-Buffer Data Reuse** : The last part of the project deepens into the buffer contribution to the total cycles of the CPU.
